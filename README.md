# Socket Programming
This repository contains examples of socket programming in Python, demonstrating how to create both client and server applications that communicate over a network.

## Examples
client3.py: A simple client that connects to a server, sends a message, and receives a response.
host3.py: A server that listens for incoming connections, processes messages from clients, and sends responses back.
